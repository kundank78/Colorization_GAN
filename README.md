# Colorization_GAN
Gray-scale Image Colorization using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network.

# Network Architecture
The architecture of generator is inspired by U-Net: The architecture of the model is symmetric, with n encoding units and n decoding units.

For discriminator, we use similar architecture as the baselines contractive path.
